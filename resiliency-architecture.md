# Architecture decisions for resiliency

{: #ad-resiliency}

The following sections summarize the resiliency architecture decisions for customer workloads deployed on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC and ROKS. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} SaaS services such as watsonx, watsonx.assistant for voice (Speech to text and Text to Speech) and Maximo being highly available by default and their disaster recovery being solely done by backing up and restoring their data, there is no actual architecture decisions for them.
