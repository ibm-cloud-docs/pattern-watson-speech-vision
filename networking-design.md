# Network design

{: #networking-design}

## Requirement

The requirements for the network aspect for this pattern focuses on the following:

* The required environment must have network connections to connect and hosting x86 virtualized workloads on Cloud.
* The required environment must have network connections to connect and hosting containizer workloads on Cloud.
* network connections to AI services on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
* network connections to all PaaS and Saas Services consuimed on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
* secured connections to Hybrid cloud environment.
* secured connections to external users and towards development pipeline to allow customer developer to write, integrate and test code including delivering via a secured pipeline.
* serverless workloads on cloud.

## Network Design considerations

For deploying AI applications, it's essential to design a robust and scalable network infrastructure that can handle the unique demands of these workloads. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure is designed to support the high-performance computing requirements of AI workloads, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and reliability.

This section details the key network design considerations for AI applications in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

## Virtual private Cloud (VPC)

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated network in an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. A VPC provides a secure, dedicated environment for applications and data, with its own subnet, IP address range, and routing. This allows to deploy and manage applications in a highly flexible and scalable manner.

### **1. Management VPC**

A Management VPC is a specialized VPC that serves as the entry point for managing the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources. It provides a secure, isolated network environment for managing the cloud resources, such as:

- Creating and managing VPCs
- Configuring network routes and subnets
- Monitoring and troubleshooting resource performance

The Management VPC is not intended for running applications, but rather serves as the control plane for managing the cloud infrastructure.

### **2. Workload VPC**

A Workload VPC is a production-grade VPC that can use to deploy and run applications. This VPC provides a scalable, high-performance environment for running various workloads, with features such as:

- Dedicated networking resources
- Support for multiple subnets and routing configurations
- Integration with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services, such as databases and message queues

Multiple Workload VPCs can be created to support different environments or applications, such as development, testing, and production.

### **3. Load Balancer**

A Load Balancer is responsible for distributing traffic across multiple instances of the AI application. They are designed to help in building resilient and scalable applications in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

* {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Load Balancer

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Load Balancer is a managed service from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. This service is available in the cloud services catalogue. Some of the key features of this services are

- HTTP/HTTPS traffic management: It can handle both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, ensuring secure communication between various application.
- TCP/UDP load balancing: It support TCP and UDP traffic, making me suitable for a wide range of applications

For more details on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Load Balancer refer to this [section in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/loadbalancer-service?topic=loadbalancer-service-about-ibm-cloud-load-balancer)
{: note}

### **4. Gateway Services**

A Gateway is a set of managed services in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. They act as a bridge between client applications and the outside world, allowing to securely expose APIs, manage traffic, and enforce policies.

***Transit Gateway***
A Transit Gateway is a managed network service that allows to simplify the network architecture and improve security by consolidating multiple networks into a single, highly available, and scalable platform.

For more details on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Transit Gateway refer to this [section in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-about)
{: note}

### ***5. Gateway VPN***

A Gateway Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that enables to establish a secure, encrypted connection between the on-premises infrastructure and the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. This allows to extend the private network into the cloud, ensuring seamless communication between the internal resources and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}-based services.

- IPsec: Supports IP Security Protocol (IPSec) for encrypting and authenticating traffic.
- MPLS: Supports Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for establishing a secure, managed connection between the on-premises infrastructure and the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
- VPG: Virtual Private Gateway provides a secure entrance point for traffic from the on-premises infrastructure to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

### ***6. Bastion Host***

A Bastion Host is a managed Linux-based virtual machine (VM) that serves as a secure entry point for accessing and managing other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources.

- It acts as a single entry point for remote access to the cloud resources, such as virtual servers, databases, or storage systems.
- Users must authenticate with the Bastion Host using their {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} credentials (e.g., API keys, usernames, and passwords) before gaining access to other resources.
- The Bastion Host creates a secure network boundary between the cloud resources and external users or systems. This helps prevent unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

## **Other Connection Services**

### ***7. VPN Connection***

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection for VPC enables to securely connect client's on-premises infrastructure or other clouds to the VPC over the internet. This provides a secure and encrypted tunnel between various networks.

In this pattern, the VPN connection is leveraged for accessing the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resoueces securely through a private connection over internet by system/cloud administrators, developer etc for various development and operational activities.

For more details on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VPN for VPC refer to this [section in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-overview&interface=ui)
{: note}

### ***8. Direct Link 2.0***

Direct Link 2.0 is a high-speed, and secure connectivity option that enables client's to establish a dedicated, always-on link between your premises and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
