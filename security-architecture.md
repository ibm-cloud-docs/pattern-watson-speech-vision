| Data Encryption for image and video files and analysis | **Encryption at Rest and in Transit**: Given the sensitive nature of the visual data (e.g., images, inspection results, AI models), ensuring that data is encrypted both at rest and in transit is critical. IBM Cloud provides built-in encryption, but it's important to confirm that all data handling complies with encryption standards, particularly for regulatory and compliance purposes. **Key Management**: Use secure key management services like **IBM Key Protect** to control and rotate encryption keys effectively. | IBM managed keys <br> Customer provided keys - IBM Key Protect <br> Customer provided and controlled keys - IBM Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS). | IBM managed keys for images and video shared for Maximo              | Native solution, compatible with all IBM Cloud services.
