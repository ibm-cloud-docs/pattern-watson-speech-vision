# Watsonx design considerations

{: #ai-products-watsonx}

## Requirements

The Watson pattern AI solution requires a range of AI components to effectively process and analyze various types of data inputs. These requirements are designed to meet specific business needs, including RAG, chat (voice, text interaction), image anlysis and video analysis.

1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): The AI system must be able to do Text Retrieval and Text Generation
2. Voice and text chat : The AI system should support voice and text interaction through various channels, such as:

   1. Speech-to-text conversion: converting spoken words into written text for processing and analysis
   2. Text to Speech conversation : converting written texts from various sources into spoken words
3. Image Detection : The AI system should include computer vision capabilities for analyzing images, such as:

   1. Object detection: recognizing specific objects within an image
   2. Image classification: categorizing images based on their content or context
4. Video Detection : The AI system must be able to process and analyze (non live) video data uploaded from various sources, including:

   1. Object tracking: following the movement of specific objects over time in a video sequence.
   2. Video analysis: detecting patterns, trends, or anomalies within a video

## Maximo Visual Inspection

The IBM Maximo Visual Inspection platform, built on cognitive infrastructure, is a new generation of video and image analysis platforms. The platform offers built-in deep learning models that learn to analyze images and video streams for classification, object detection, and anomaly detection.

![Visual Inspection for image and Video.](image/functional-flows-architecture-image-classification-on-ibmcloud.svg "Image and Video analysis"){: caption="Figure 1. Video and image analysis watson pattern" caption-side="bottom"}

Maximo Visual Inspection includes tools and interfaces for anyone who has limited skills in deep learning technologies. You can use IBM Maximo Visual Inspection to label images and videos that can be used to train and validate a model. The model can then be validated and deployed in customized solutions that demand image classification, object detection, and anomaly detection.

### Integrating with Maximo Visual Inspection Edge

Maximo Visual Inspection Edge is a web-based application that you can integrate with Maximo Visual Inspection to perform AI-based inspections at the edge. You can collect images to train AI models or use trained models to inspect images from cameras that are positioned close to edge activities, such as assembly-line operations.

Maximo Visual Inspection Edge uses data sets and trained models that are stored in  Maximo Visual Inspection. In Maximo Visual Inspection Edge, you create inspections that process images from input sources, such as cameras or network folders. These inspections either collect images to train models or use trained models and rules to inspect images. You specify the data sets where you want to store the processed images so that models can be refined and retrained.

### IBM Cloud Speech to Text service

![Watson Speech.](image/functional-flows-speech-to-text-transcription-pipeline-with-labels.svg "Watson Speech"){: caption="Figure 1. Speech to Text transcription pipeline" caption-side="bottom"}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Speech to Text service converts the human voice into the written word. The service uses deep-learning artificial intelligence to apply knowledge of grammar, language structure, and the composition of audio and voice signals to accurately transcribe human speech. It can be used in applications such as voice-automated chatbots, analytic tools for customer-service call centers, and multi-media transcription, among many others.

The service is available in multiple languages and is exposed as an http interface and a websocket interface. It can be accessed using a public or a private endpoint. [Getting started with Watson Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-gettingStarted)

### IBM Cloud Text to Speech service

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Text to Speech service converts written text to natural-sounding speech. The service streams the synthesized audio back with minimal delay. The audio uses appropriate cadence and intonation for its language and dialect to provide voices that are smooth and natural. The service can be used in applications such as voice-automated chatbots, as well as a variety of voice-driven and screenless applications, such as tools for the disabled or visually impaired, video narration and voice over, and educational and home-automation solutions.

Watson speech services

Watson Speech to Text transcribes written text from spoken audio. The service leverages machine learning to combine knowledge of grammar, language structure, and the composition of audio and voice signals to accurately transcribe the human voice. It continuously updates and refines its transcription as it receives more speech audio.

For more information about the service, see [About Watson Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-about "(Opens in a new tab or window)").Watson Text to Speech synthesizes natural-sounding speech from written text. The service streams the results back to the client with minimal delay. The service is appropriate for voice-driven and screenless applications, where audio is the preferred method of output.
