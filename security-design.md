## Security Considerations for AI

When implementing an Enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution, there are several key security considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Data Security** : Protect sensitive data used to train and deploy AI models. This includes ensuring that all data is properly encrypted, access-controlled, and compliant with relevant regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
2. **Model Integrity** : Verify the integrity of trained AI models by checking for tampering or manipulation during development, deployment, and updates. Implement model signing and verification mechanisms to ensure only authorized models are used.
3. **Explainability** : Ensure that AI decision-making processes can be explained and audited, which is critical for accountability and transparency in high-stakes applications like healthcare or finance.
4. **Bias Detection**: Identify and mitigate potential biases in AI models, as they can perpetuate existing inequalities if left unchecked. Regularly monitor model performance on diverse datasets to detect any biases.
5. **Compliance with Regulations** : Ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others that govern data privacy and security. Implement measures like data anonymization, pseudonymization, or aggregation to meet these requirements.
6. **Access Control** : Implement robust access control mechanisms for users, roles, and organizations to prevent unauthorized access to AI models, data, and infrastructure.
7. **Secure Infrastructure** : Deploy Enterprise AI solutions on secure infrastructure that complies with relevant regulations and industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS for payment systems).
8. **Model Updates and Deployment** : Establish a secure process for updating and deploying AI models, ensuring that only authorized versions are used in production environments.
9. **Error Handling and Recovery** : Develop robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to minimize the impact of AI system failures or errors on business operations.
10. **Transparency and Auditability** : Maintain transparency throughout the AI development lifecycle by logging all changes, updates, and decisions made by AI systems. This enables auditing and compliance with regulations.
11. **Secure Communication Channels** : Establish secure communication channels for data exchange between AI components, users, and other systems to prevent eavesdropping or tampering.
12. **Regular Security Audits and Testing** : Perform regular security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in the Enterprise AI solution before attackers can exploit them.

When implementing an AI-powered speech recognition and image detection solution, the following security considerations should be taken into account:

### **Speech Recognition:**

1. **Audio Data Security** : Ensure that all audio data is properly encrypted and protected from unauthorized access or tampering.
2. **Vulnerability to Eavesdropping** : Implement secure communication channels for transmitting audio data between devices or services to prevent eavesdropping on sensitive conversations.
3. **False Audio Input Detection** : Develop mechanisms to detect and filter out false or manipulated audio inputs, such as voice commands from unauthorized sources.
4. **Audio Data Authentication** : Ensure the authenticity of audio data by using digital signatures or other authentication methods to verify its origin.

### **Image Detection:**

1. **Visual Data Security** : Protect visual data (images) with robust encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized viewing, tampering, or theft.
2. **Object Detection Vulnerability** : Implement secure object detection algorithms that are resistant to manipulation or spoofing attacks, which could potentially compromise the system's integrity.

## Platform Security Requirements and Considerations

The exact security requirements of the solution will be specific to each customer, however attention should be given to the following areas as a miminum.

| Network security                                                            | **Isolation:** Ensure proper network isolation for the VPC VSIs and ROKS workloads components based on the unique customer's requirements (e.g. based on the environment type). Inside the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, security controls such as IBM Cloud VPC's network ACLs, security groups (see [Security in your VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-security-in-your-vpc) and [VPC Network isolation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain#network-isolation)) as well as ROKS network policies (see [ROKS network policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-network_policies))should be used. If public access to the applications hosted in the environment is needed, IBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS) can help to filter and steer the traffic to the correct environment, thus providing some additional degree of isolation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Access control                                                              | **Role-based access control (RBAC):** Leverage IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to implement RBAC to restrict access to the resources in the IBM Cloud environment based on job responsibilities, ensuring that only authorized personnel can configure and manage. **Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for accessing the IBM Cloud console and associated interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Data encryption                                                             | **In-transit encryption:** Enable encryption for data in transit where possible to prevent interception and tampering. Use secure communication protocols like TLS. For the workloads, this can be done at the application level (IBM Cloud VPC VSIs or ROKs containers) or at the platform level (for instance use ROKS service mesh capability, see [Service Mesh on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-openshift-service-mesh)). Regarding the as a service components of the solution, IBM Cloud Text to Speech, IBM Cloud Speech to Text and Maximo Visual Inspection all support TLS natively via their https, websocket or REST API interfaces. For more information, see [Text to Speech data security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-data-security) and [Speech to Text data security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-data-security). **At-rest encryption:** IBM Cloud IaaS and SaaS offerings all provide encryption at rest by default using IBM managed keys. By leveraging IBM Cloud Key Protect it is possible for the customer to provide his own encryption keys. Note that in the case of IBM Cloud Code Engine, Code Engine does not store the container image data but instead points to a container image repository, the container image repository implementing the encryption of the image. |
