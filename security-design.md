| Network security                                                                     | **Isolation:** Ensure proper network isolation for the VPC VSIs and ROKS workloads components based on the unique customer's requirements (e.g. based on the environment type). Inside the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, security controls such as {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VPC's network ACLs, security groups (see [Security in your VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-security-in-your-vpc) and [VPC Network isolation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain#network-isolation)) as well as ROKS network policies (see [ROKS network policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-network_policies))should be used. If public access to the applications hosted in the environment is needed, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Internet Services (CIS) can help to filter and steer the traffic to the correct environment, thus providing some additional degree of isolation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Access control                                                                       | **Role-based access control (RBAC):** Leverage {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) to implement RBAC to restrict access to the resources in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment based on job responsibilities, ensuring that only authorized personnel can configure and manage. **Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for accessing the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console and associated interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Data encryption                                                                      | **In-transit encryption:** Enable encryption for data in transit where possible to prevent interception and tampering. Use secure communication protocols like TLS. For the workloads, this can be done at the application level ({{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VPC VSIs or ROKs containers) or at the platform level (for instance use ROKS service mesh capability, see [Service Mesh on Red Hat OpenShift on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-openshift-service-mesh)). Regarding the as a service components of the solution, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Text to Speech, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Speech to Text and Maximo Visual Inspection all support TLS natively via their https, websocket or REST API interfaces. For more information, see [Text to Speech data security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-data-security) and [Speech to Text data security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-data-security). **At-rest encryption:** {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IaaS and SaaS offerings all provide encryption at rest by default using IBM managed keys. By leveraging {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Key Protect it is possible for the customer to provide his own encryption keys. Note that in the case of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Code Engine, Code Engine does not store the container image data but instead points to a container image repository, the container image repository implementing the encryption of the image. |
