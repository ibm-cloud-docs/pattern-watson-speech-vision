# DevOps Tool Chain
{: #devops-design}

IBM Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of DevOps tools designed to streamline the development, deployment, and management of applications. Here are some key DevOps tools available on IBM Cloud.

## 1. Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) in IBM Cloud refers to the practice of automatically building, testing, and verifying the quality of software code changes as soon as they are committed to a repository. This process helps to ensure that the code is stable, secure, and functions as expected, reducing the risk of errors and defects that can occur later in the development lifecycle.

For details about Continuous Integration refer to this [section in IBM Cloud Docs](https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-integration)
{: note}

Overall, Continuous Integration in IBM Cloud helps to streamline the software development process, improve code quality, and reduce the risk of errors and defects, allowing developers to deliver high-quality applications faster and more efficiently.

## 2. IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery

 **Toolchains** :

* Toolchains integrate various tools to automate all stages of software development and deployment. You can include tools like GitHub for version control, Jenkins for continuous integration, and Slack for team communication. This integration streamlines workflows and ensures consistent, automated processes across your DevOps pipeline.

 **Delivery Pipeline** :

* The Delivery Pipeline service allows you to automate the build, test, and deploy phases of your application. It supports custom scripts and integrates with other tools to enable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

For getting started with IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery refer to this [section in IBM Cloud Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-getting-started)

## 3. IBM Cloud Container Registry

IBM Cloud Container Registry is a managed container registry service that allows you to store, manage, and deploy container images, such as Docker images, in a secure and scalable manner.


For details about IBM Cloud Container Registry refer to this [section in IBM Cloud Docs]https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-started)
{: note}

By using IBM Cloud Container Registry, you can streamline your container management and deployment processes, improve security and scalability, and accelerate the development and deployment of your containerized applications.

## 4. IBM Cloud DevOps Insights

* DevOps Insights provides data-driven insights into your code quality and the health of your DevOps processes. It aggregates data from various tools (like Git, Jenkins, and SonarQube) to give you a comprehensive view of your project's status and performance, enabling better decision-making and improving software quality.
