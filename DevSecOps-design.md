# DevOps Tool Chain

{: #security-design}

IBM Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of DevOps tools designed to streamline the development, deployment, and management of applications. Here are some key DevOps tools available on IBM Cloud.

## 1. IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery

 **Toolchains** :

* Toolchains integrate various tools to automate all stages of software development and deployment. You can include tools like GitHub for version control, Jenkins for continuous integration, and Slack for team communication. This integration streamlines workflows and ensures consistent, automated processes across your DevOps pipeline.

 **Delivery Pipeline** :

* The Delivery Pipeline service allows you to automate the build, test, and deploy phases of your application. It supports custom scripts and integrates with other tools to enable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## 2. IBM Cloud Code Engine

* Code Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform that simplifies running applications, jobs, and containers. It abstracts the infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code. It supports a variety of workloads, including microservices, batch jobs, and event-driven functions.

## 3. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

* This is a managed Kubernetes offering that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. It provides an integrated experience with built-in security and compliance features. Kubernetes orchestration is handled by IBM, allowing developers to focus on their applications rather than infrastructure management.

## 4. IBM Cloud Functions

* Cloud Functions is IBM's serverless computing platform, which allows you to execute code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. It's based on Apache OpenWhisk and supports various programming languages. Use cases include microservices, data processing, and IoT applications.

## 5. IBM Cloud DevOps Insights

* DevOps Insights provides data-driven insights into your code quality and the health of your DevOps processes. It aggregates data from various tools (like Git, Jenkins, and SonarQube) to give you a comprehensive view of your project's status and performance, enabling better decision-making and improving software quality.

## 6. IBM UrbanCode

 **UrbanCode Deploy** :

* Automates application deployments across various environments, supporting complex application release automation and continuous delivery. It ensures consistency and reliability by managing deployments and rollbacks.

 **UrbanCode Release** :

* Orchestrates and automates the release process, helping manage and coordinate releases across different teams and environments. It supports planning, execution, and tracking of releases.

 **UrbanCode Velocity** :

* Provides visibility into your DevOps processes with metrics and insights. It helps you track progress, identify bottlenecks, and measure performance, fostering continuous improvement.

## 7. Tekton Pipelines

* Tekton is an open-source framework for creating cloud-native CI/CD pipelines. Integrated with IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery, it allows you to define and run pipelines that automate the building, testing, and deploying of applications.

## 8. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

* A managed OpenShift service that provides a Kubernetes-based platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. OpenShift adds developer and operational tools on top of Kubernetes, providing a more comprehensive platform for enterprise-grade applications.

## 9. Cloud Foundry

* Cloud Foundry is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows you to deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, providing a consistent environment for developing, testing, and scaling applications.

## 10. IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig

* Sysdig offers monitoring and alerting capabilities for your applications and infrastructure. It provides real-time visibility into system performance, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues. It supports container and Kubernetes monitoring, making it ideal for modern cloud-native environments.

## 11. IBM Cloud Log Analysis with LogDNA

* LogDNA is a centralized log management tool that helps you collect, monitor, and analyze log data from your applications and infrastructure. It enables efficient troubleshooting and operational insights, ensuring better application performance and reliability.

These tools collectively support the entire DevOps lifecycle, from code development to deployment and monitoring, providing a robust environment for modern application development on IBM Cloud



### Code Testing Tools on IBM Cloud

1. **IBM Rational Test Workbench** :

* Provides a comprehensive test automation solution for functional, performance, and regression testing. It supports a wide range of applications and integrates with other IBM DevOps tools.

1. **IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery** :

* Supports integration with various testing tools like Selenium, JUnit, and others within its toolchains, allowing you to automate testing as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

### Code Scanning and Analysis Tools on IBM Cloud

1. **IBM Application Security on Cloud (ASoC)** :

* A comprehensive security testing service that provides static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), and mobile security testing. It helps identify vulnerabilities in your applications before they go into production.

1. **IBM Guardium Analyzer** :

* Analyzes database activity to detect and respond to security threats, ensuring compliance with data security policies.

1. **IBM Security QRadar** :

* Integrates with IBM Cloud to provide security intelligence and analytics. It helps identify security threats by analyzing logs, network flows, and vulnerabilities.

1. **IBM Cloud DevOps Insights** :

* Provides data-driven insights into the quality of your code and the health of your DevOps processes. It integrates with various code analysis and scanning tools to give you a comprehensive view of your code's security posture.

### Additional IBM Cloud Security Tools

1. **IBM X-Force Exchange** :

* A threat intelligence platform that helps you stay informed about the latest security threats and vulnerabilities, which can be integrated into your DevSecOps processes.

1. **IBM Cloud Security Advisor** :

* Provides a unified dashboard for monitoring and managing the security posture of your IBM Cloud resources, offering recommendations and alerts for potential security issues.

1. **IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)** :

* Ensures secure access to your cloud resources by managing user identities, roles, and permissions.

1. **IBM DataShield** :

* Provides runtime encryption for applications, ensuring that data is protected even when in use.

### Integrating Third-Party Tools with IBM Cloud

IBM Cloud also supports integrating third-party DevSecOps tools to enhance security in your development pipeline. Tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode, and Snyk can be integrated into IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery toolchains to provide comprehensive code analysis, scanning, and testing capabilities.
