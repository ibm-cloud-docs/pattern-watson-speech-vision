# IBM Watson Surround

{: #genai-pattern}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

AI holds the promise to transform life and business but raises concerns around trust, security, and regulatory compliance. Understanding gen AI and its infrastructure is vital for navigating its complex landscape.
This reference architecture summarizes the best practices for a watsonx gen AI deployment on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, focusing on augmenting the standard watsonx offering with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} speech to text, text to speech, and computer vision capabilities. The IBM Watson Surround pattern covers the following items:

1. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} watsonx RAG overview
2. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Watson Assistant with Speech to Text and Text to Speech
3. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Maximo Visual Inspection for image and video detection

## Architecture diagram

{: #architecture-diagram}

The following diagram represents the architecture for watsonx on gen AI on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} with computer vision by using Maximo and conversation chat with Watson speech and text.

Central to the architecture are three VPCs, which provide for separation of concerns between provider management functions and consumer workloads.

* Management VPC: Provides compute, storage, and network services to enable the client or service provider's administrators to monitor, operate, and maintain the environment.
* Workload VPC: Provides compute, storage, and network services to support hosted applications and operations that deliver services to the consumer.
  The customer can host their workloads in the cluster as needed, such as a production, nonproduction, test, and dev cluster. Maximo Visual Inspection is deployed on a separate cluster on the Red Hat OpenShift environment. For more information, see the design considerations and reference sections.

## Compliance

{: #compliance}

* CI / CD / CC Pipelines: The Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and Continuous Compliance (CC) pipelines, referred to as [DevSecOps Application Lifecycle Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/architecture/deploy-arch-ibm-devsecops-alm-e1c16cac-7ea8-413f-a819-67e3a3251e44-global?catalog_query=aHR0cHM6Ly9jbG91ZC5pYm0uY29tL2NhdGFsb2cjcmVmZXJlbmNlX2FyY2hpdGVjdHVyZQ%3D%3D) are used to deploy the application, check for vulnerabilities, and ensure auditability. Below are some of important compliance features of DevSecOps Application Lifecycle Management:
  * Vulnerability Scans: Vulnerability scans involve using specialized tools to look for security vulnerabilities in the code. This is crucial to identify and fix potential security issues before they become a problem in production.
  * Sign Build Artifacts: The code is compiled and built into software or application artifacts (like executable files or libraries). These artifacts are then digitally signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
  * Evidence Gathering: This involves collecting and storing evidence of the development process, such as commit logs, build logs, and other relevant data. It helps in tracing back and understanding what happened at different stages of development.
  * **Evidence Locker: This involves collecting and storing evidence of the development process, such as commit logs, build logs, and other relevant data. This helps in tracing back and understanding what happened at different stages of development.
* Security and Compliance Center (SCC): This reference architecture utilizes the Security and Compliance Center which defines policy as code, implements controls for secure data and workload deployments, and assess security and compliance posture. For this reference architecture two profiles are used, the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Framework for Financial Services](/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-overview) and AI ICT Guardrails. A profile is a grouping of controls that can be evaluated for compliance.
