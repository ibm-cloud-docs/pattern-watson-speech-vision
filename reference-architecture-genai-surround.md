{: #genai-pattern}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}



AI holds the promise to transform life and business but raises concerns around trust, security, and regulatory compliance. Understanding Gen AI and its infrastructure is vital for navigating its complex landscape.

This reference architecture summarizes the best practices for Watsonx Gen AI Pattern deployment on IBM Cloud, focusing on augmenting the standard Watsonx offering  with IBM Cloud speech to text/text to speech and computer vision capabilities to achieve an end to end workflow for customer care.

The following pattern covers

1. IBM Watsonx RAG pattern.
2. IBM Watson assistant with Speech to Text and Text to Speech
3. IBM Maximo Visual Inspection for image and vide detection.

## Architecture diagram

{: #architecture-diagram}

The below diagram represents the architecture for Gen AI on IBM cloud and reuses the [best practices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about) for IBM Cloud for Financial Services and [VPC reference architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about).

![Architecture.](image/ref-arch-watsonx-surround.svg "Architecture"){: caption="Figure 4. Reference Architecture" caption-side="bottom"}

Central to the architecture are three VPCs, which provide for separation of concerns between provider management functionality and consumer workloads.

**Management VPC**
Provides compute, storage, and network services to enable the client or service provider's administrators to monitor, operate, and maintain the environment.

**Workload VPC**
Provides compute, storage, and network services to support hosted applications and operations that deliver services to the consumer.

**Edge VPC**
The edge VPC is used to enhance boundary protection for the workload VPC, and allows consumers to access Gen AI User Interface through the public internet. [(see here)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-connectivity-workload#consumer-provider-different-org)

Other features of the reference architecture:

* Can reside in one or more multizone regions to provide additional resiliency.
* Enables access to the management VPC from the application provider's enterprise environment through IBM Cloud Virtual Private Network Gateway for VPC.
* Provides connectivity from the consumer's enterprise environment to the workload VPC through Direct Link.
* Connects management VPC, workload VPC, and Edge VPC by using IBM Cloud Transit Gateway.
* Extends the watsonx default capabilities to voice and images by leveraging IBM Cloud Speech to Text, Text to Speech and Maximo Visual Inspection software as a service offerings

## Compliance

{: #compliance}

**CI / CD / CC Pipelines** `<br>`
The Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and Continuous Compliance (CC) pipelines, referred to as [DevSecOps Application Lifecycle Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/architecture/deploy-arch-ibm-devsecops-alm-e1c16cac-7ea8-413f-a819-67e3a3251e44-global?catalog_query=aHR0cHM6Ly9jbG91ZC5pYm0uY29tL2NhdGFsb2cjcmVmZXJlbmNlX2FyY2hpdGVjdHVyZQ%3D%3D) are used to deploy the application, check for vulnerabilities, and ensure auditability. Below are some of important compliance features of DevSecOps Application Lifecycle Management:

* **Vulnerability Scans** `<br>`
  Vulnerability scans involve using specialized tools to look for security vulnerabilities in the code. This is crucial to identify and fix potential security issues before they become a problem in production.
* **Sign Build Artifacts** `<br>`
  The code is compiled and built into software or application artifacts (like executable files or libraries). These artifacts are then digitally signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
* **Evidence Gathering** `<br>`
  This involves collecting and storing evidence of the development process, such as commit logs, build logs, and other relevant data. It helps in tracing back and understanding what happened at different stages of development.
* **Evidence Locker** `<br>`
  This involves collecting and storing evidence of the development process, such as commit logs, build logs, and other relevant data. This helps in tracing back and understanding what happened at different stages of development.

**Security and Compliance Center (SCC)** `<br>`
This reference architecture utilizes the Security and Compliance Center (SCC) which defines policy as code, implements controls for secure data and workload deployments and assess security and compliance posture. For this reference architecture two profiles are used. The [**IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-overview) and **AI ICT Guardrails**. A profile is a grouping of controls that can be evaluated for compliance.
