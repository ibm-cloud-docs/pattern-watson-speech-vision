# Vector Database design

{: #compute-design}

Enter [vectors](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/essl/7.1). Vectors are arrays of numbers that can represent complex objects like words, images, videos and audio, generated by a [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) (ML) model. High-dimensional vector data is essential to machine learning, [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) (NLP) and other AI tasks. Some examples of vector data include:

* Text: Think about the last time you interacted with a chatbot. How do they understand natural language? They rely on vectors which can represent words, paragraphs and entire documents, that are converted via machine learning algorithms.
* Images: Image pixels can be described by numerical data and combined to make up a high-dimensional vector for that image.
* Speech/Audio: Like images, sound waves can also be broken down into numerical data and represented as vectors, enabling AI applications such as voice recognition.

## Vector databases and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

Enterprises are increasingly favoring [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) approach in generative AI workflows for its faster time-to-market, efficient inference and reliable output, particularly in key use cases such as customer care and HR/Talent. RAG ensures that the model is linked to the most current, reliable facts and that users have access to the model’s sources, so that its claims can be checked for accuracy. RAG is core to our ability to anchor large language models in trusted data to reduce model hallucinations. This approach relies on leveraging high-dimensional vector data to enrich prompts with semantically relevant information for in-context learning by foundation models. It requires effective storage and retrieval during the inference stage, which handles the highest volume of data. Vector databases excel at efficiently indexing, storing and retrieving these high-dimensional vectors, providing the speed, precision and scale needed for applications like recommendation engines and chatbots.

## Advantages of vector databases

While it’s clear that vector database functionality is rapidly growing in interest and adoption to enhance enterprise AI-based applications, the following benefits have also demonstrated business value for adopters:

 **Speed and performance** : Vector databases use various indexing techniques to enable faster searching. Vector indexing along with distance-calculating algorithms such as nearest neighbor search, are particularly helpful with searching for relevant results across millions if not billions of data points, with optimized performance.

 **Scalability** : Vector databases can store and manage massive amounts of unstructured data by scaling horizontally, maintaining performance as query demands and data volumes increase.

 **Cost of ownership** : Vector databases are a valuable alternative to training foundation models from scratch or fine-tuning them. This reduces the cost and speed of inferencing of foundation models.

 **Flexibility** : Whether you have images, videos or other multi-dimensional data, vector databases are built to handle complexity. Given the multiple use cases ranging from semantic search to conversational AI applications, the use of vector databases can be customized to meet your business and AI requirements.

 **Long term memory of LLMs** : Organizations can start with a general-purpose models like IBM [watsonx.ai’s Granite](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) series models, Meta's Llama-2 or Google's Flan models, and then provide their own data in a vector database to enhance the output of the models and AI applications critical to retrieval augmented generation.

 **Data management components** : Vector databases also typically provide built-in features to easily update and insert new unstructured data.

[]()Considerations for vector databases and your data strategy

There is a breadth of options when it comes to choosing a vector database capability to meet your organization’s data and AI needs.

## Types of vector databases

There are a few alternatives to choose from.

* Standalone, proprietary vector databases such as Pinecone
* Open-source solutions such as weaviate or milvus, which provide built-in RESTful APIs and support for Python and Java programming languages
* Platforms with vector database capabilities integrated, coming soon to [IBM watsonx.data](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data)
* Vector database/search extensions such as PostgreSQL’s open source pgvector extension, providing vector similarity search capabilities

### IBM Cloud Databases for Elasticsearch

Our Elasticsearch database-as-a-service comes with a full-text search engine, which makes it the perfect home for your unstructured text data. Elasticsearch also support various forms of  [semantic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.9/semantic-search.html) (link resides outside ibm.com) similarity search. It supports [dense vectors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dense-vector.html) (link resides outside ibm.com) for exact nearest neighbor search, but it also provides built-in AI models to compute sparse vectors and conduct [advanced similarity search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/8.9/ml-nlp-elser.html) (link resides outside ibm.com).

1. A VPC Landing Zone is deployed which provides the ability to automate the installation of an Red Hat OpenShift cluster into a multizone region.
2. Three separate clusters are created for the production, pre-production, and dev and test environments. The diagram depicts only the production cluster.
3. Separate worker pools are created within the clusters for the application and storage workloads.
4. The worker pool node size and quantity are determined based on the resource requirements for the application and storage workloads.
5. To meet the Red Hat OpenShift on VPC service availability Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99%, a minimum of 6 worker nodes are equally distributed across three availability zones.
6. Total worker node capacity is sized at 150% of the total workload's required capacity, so that if one zone fails, the resources are available to maintain the workload.
7. By default, the cluster is provisioned with a VPC security group and a cluster-level security group.
8. The Red Hat OpenShift platform is integrated with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}d Services to provide centralized cluster observability services.
